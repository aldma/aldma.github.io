					Optimization problems with convex quadratic cost and polyhedral constraints are ubiquitous in signal processing,
					automatic control and decision-making. We consider here an enlarged problem class that allows to encode logical 
					conditions and cardinality constraints, among others. In particular, we cover also situations where parts of the 
					constraints are nonconvex and possibly complicated, but it is practical to compute projections onto this nonconvex 
					set. Our approach combines the augmented Lagrangian framework with a solver-agnostic structure-exploiting subproblem 
					reformulation. While convergence guarantees follow from the former, the proposed condensing technique leads to 
					significant improvements in computational performance.

					Quadratic programming is a workhorse of modern nonlinear optimization, control, and data science. Although
					regularized methods offer convergence guarantees under minimal assumptions on the problem data, they can
					exhibit the slow tail-convergence typical of first-order schemes, thus requiring many iterations to achieve 
					high-accuracy solutions. Moreover, hyperparameter tuning significantly impacts on the solver performance but 
					how to find an appropriate parameter configuration remains an elusive research question. To address these 
					issues, we explore how data-driven approaches can accelerate the solution process. Aiming at high-accuracy 
					solutions, we focus on a stabilized interior-point solver and carefully handle its two-loop flow and control 
					parameters. We will show that reinforcement learning can make a significant contribution to facilitating the 
					solver tuning and to speeding up the optimization process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, after a 
					lightweight training, the learned policy generalizes well to different problem classes with varying dimensions 
					and to various solver configurations.

					We extend the control formalism of task-space inverse dynamics, classically formulated as a quadratic program, to a 
					quadratic program with complementarity constraints (QPCC) that fully accounts for actuator limits and frictional 
					contacts modeled as nonlinear complementary constraints. Inspired by the alternating direction method of multipliers, 
					we propose an iterative optimization approach that alternates between minimizing a smooth convex function accounting 
					for task objectives and system dynamics, and projecting onto convex and non-convex sets that capture actuator and 
					contact constraints. By handling complementary frictional contact constraints through projection, our approach implicitly 
					and automatically infers the optimal contact modes that fulfill the task objectives and constraints. We have implemented 
					our QPCC solver in C++ for efficiency, and demonstrate its usability and versatility on rigid and soft robots across 
					various control scenarios, ranging from the control of actuated box sliding on the grounds, to control balance of legged 
					robots that automatically break and create contacts with the ground or control of deformable robots interacting with 
					their environment.

					Necessary optimality conditions in Lagrangian form and the augmented Lagrangian framework are 
					extended to mixed-integer nonlinear optimization, without any convexity assumptions. Building 
					upon a recently developed notion of local optimality for problems with polyhedral and integrality 
					constraints, a characterization of local minimizers and critical points is given for problems 
					including also nonlinear constraints. This approach lays the foundations for developing affordable 
					sequential minimization algorithms with convergence guarantees to critical points from arbitrary 
					initializations. A primal-dual perspective, a local saddle point property, and the dual relationships 
					with the proximal point algorithm are also advanced in the presence of integer variables.

					We consider minimization problems with structured objective function and smooth constraints, and present a flexible 
					framework that combines the beneficial regularization effects of (exact) penalty and interior-point methods. In the 
					fully nonconvex setting, a pure barrier approach requires careful steps when approaching the infeasible set, thus 
					hindering convergence. We show how a tight integration with a penalty scheme mitigates this issue and enables the 
					construction of subproblems whose domain is independent of the explicit constraints. This decoupling allows us to 
					leverage efficient solvers designed for unconstrained or suitably structured optimization tasks. The key behind all 
					this is a marginalization step: closely related to a conjugacy operation, this step effectively merges (exact) penalty 
					and barrier into a smooth, full domain functional object. When the penalty exactness takes effect, the generated 
					subproblems do not suffer the ill-conditioning typical of barrier methods, nor do they exhibit the nonsmoothness of 
					exact penalty terms. We provide a theoretical characterization of the algorithm and its asymptotic properties, deriving 
					convergence results for fully nonconvex problems. Stronger conclusions are available for the convex setting, where 
					optimality can be guaranteed. Illustrative examples and numerical simulations demonstrate the wide range of problems 
					our theory and algorithm are able to cover.

					Bringing together nonlinear optimization with polyhedral and integrality constraints enables versatile
					modeling, but poses significant computational challenges.
					We investigate a method to address these problems based on sequential mixed-integer linearization with 
					trust region safeguard, computing feasible iterates via calls to a generic mixed-integer linear
					solver.
					Convergence to critical, possibly suboptimal, feasible points is established for arbitrary starting
					points.
					Finally, we present numerical applications in nonsmooth optimal control and optimal network design
					and operation.

					We consider structured minimization problems subject to smooth inequality constraints and
					present a flexible algorithm that combines interior point (IP) and proximal gradient schemes. While
					traditional IP methods cannot cope with nonsmooth objective functions and proximal algorithms
					cannot handle complicated constraints, their combined usage is shown to successfully compensate the
					respective shortcomings. We provide a theoretical characterization of the algorithm and its asymptotic
					properties, deriving convergence results for fully nonconvex problems, thus bridging the gap
					with previous works that successfully addressed the convex case. Our interior proximal gradient algorithm
					benefits from warm starting, generates strictly feasible iterates with decreasing objective value,
					and returns after finitely many iterations a primal-dual pair approximately satisfying suitable optimality
					conditions. As a byproduct of our analysis of proximal gradient iterations we demonstrate
					that a slight refinement of traditional backtracking techniques waives the need for upper bounding
					the stepsize sequence, as required in existing results for the nonconvex setting.

					A broad class of optimization problems can be cast in composite form,

					considering the minimization
					of the composition of a lower semicontinuous function
					with a differentiable mapping.
					This paper investigates the versatile template of composite optimization 
					without any convexity assumptions.
					First- and second-order optimality conditions are discussed.
					We highlight the difficulties that stem from the lack of convexity
					when dealing with necessary conditions in a Lagrangian framework
					and when considering error bounds.
					Building upon these characterizations,
					a local convergence analysis is delineated for a recently developed augmented Lagrangian method,
					deriving rates of convergence in the fully nonconvex setting.

					Generalized nonlinear programming is considered without any convexity assumption, capturing
					a variety of problems that include nonsmooth objectives, combinatorial structures, and
					set-membership nonlinear constraints. We extend the augmented Lagrangian framework to
					this broad problem class, preserving an implicit formulation and introducing auxiliary variables
					merely as a formal device. This, however, gives rise to a generalized augmented Lagrangian
					function that lacks regularity. Based on parametric optimization, we develop a tailored
					stationarity concept to better qualify the iterates, generated as approximate solutions
					to a sequence of subproblems. Using this variational characterization and the lifted
					representation, asymptotic properties and convergence guarantees are established for a
					safeguarded augmented Lagrangian scheme. Numerical examples showcase the modelling versatility
					gained by dropping convexity assumptions and the practical benefits of the advocated implicit
					approach.

					Complex IoT ecosystems often require the usage of Digital Twins (DTs) of their physical assets in
					order to perform predictive analytics and simulate what-if scenarios. DTs are able to replicate IoT
					devices and adapt over time to their behavioral changes. However, DTs in IoT are typically tailored
					to a specific use case, without the possibility to seamlessly adapt to different scenarios. Further,
					the fragmentation of IoT poses additional challenges on how to deploy DTs in heterogeneous scenarios
					characterized by the usage of multiple data formats and IoT network protocols. In this paper, we
					propose the Relativistic Digital Twin (RDT) framework, through which we automatically generate
					general-purpose DTs of IoT entities and tune their behavioral models over time by constantly
					observing their real counterparts. The framework relies on the object representation via the Web of
					Things (WoT), to offer a standardized interface to each of the IoT devices as well as to their DTs.
					To this purpose, we extended the W3C WoT standard in order to encompass the concept of behavioral
					model and define it in the Thing Description (TD) through a new vocabulary. Finally, we evaluated
					the RDT framework over two disjoint use cases to assess its correctness and learning performance,
					i.e., the DT of a simulated smart home scenario with the capability of forecasting the indoor
					temperature, and the DT of a real-world drone with the capability of forecasting its trajectory in
					an outdoor scenario. Experiments show that the generated DT can estimate the behavior of its real
					counterpart after an observation stage, regardless of the considered scenario.

					Direct optimal control techniques, relying on numerical methods for constrained optimization, are
					typically used in trajectory planning tasks in high-dimensional spaces.
					However, general-purpose solvers often fail to find a feasible solution when facing cluttered
					environments.
					Sampling- or graph-based methods, instead, can explore complex configuration spaces but struggle
					with dynamic constraints.
					Here, we propose to combine dynamic programming (DP) and derivative-based methods to reliably solve
					trajectory planning problems.
					Specifically, we exploit DP to generate a sequence of waypoints in a low-dimensional space, which
					are then encoded as pointwise path constraints for a high-dimensional trajectory, whose constraint
					violations are then represented as a penalty within the Bellman equation to recompute the waypoints.
					This iterative approach, alternating path and trajectory optimization, avoids both the curse of
					dimensionality for DP and problematic nonconvexities (such as obstacles) for motion planning.
					We demonstrate our strategy using numerical experiments on a six-degree-of-freedom robotic
					manipulator moving in a confined space.

					We address composite optimization problems, which consist in minimizing the
					sum of a smooth and a merely lower semicontinuous function, without any
					convexity assumptions. Numerical solutions of these problems can be obtained by
					proximal gradient methods, which often rely on a line search procedure as
					globalization mechanism. We consider an adaptive nonmonotone proximal gradient
					scheme based on an averaged merit function and establish asymptotic convergence
					guarantees under weak assumptions, delivering results on par with the monotone
					strategy. Finally, we derive global worst-case rates for the iterates and a
					stationarity measure.

					We investigate finite-dimensional constrained structured optimization problems, featuring composite

					Offering an expressive yet simple language, this problem class provides a modeling framework for a

					We study stationarity and regularity concepts, and propose a flexible augmented Lagrangian scheme.
					We provide a theoretical characterization of the algorithm and its asymptotic properties, deriving
					convergence results for fully nonconvex problems.
					It is demonstrated how the inner subproblems can be solved by off-the-shelf proximal methods,
					notwithstanding the possibility to adopt any solvers, insofar as they return approximate stationary
					points.
					Finally, we describe our matrix-free implementation of the proposed algorithm and test it

					Illustrative examples show the versatility of constrained composite programs as a modeling tool and

					We present a novel approach for approximating the primal and dual parameter-dependent
					solution functions of parametric optimization problems. We start with an
					equation reformulation of the first-order necessary optimality conditions. Then, we
					replace the primal and dual solutions with some approximating functions and find
					for some test parameters optimal coefficients as solution of a single nonlinear least-squares
					problem. Under mild assumptions it can be shown that stationary points are
					global minima and that the function approximations interpolate the solution functions
					at all test parameters. Further, we have a cheap function evaluation criterion to estimate
					the approximation error. Finally, we present some preliminary numerical results
					showing the viability of our approach.

					Composite optimization offers a powerful modeling tool for a variety of applications and is
					often numerically solved by means of proximal gradient methods. In this paper, we consider
					fully nonconvex composite problems under only local Lipschitz gradient continuity for the
					smooth part of the objective function. We investigate an adaptive scheme for PANOC-type methods
					(Stella et al. in Proceedings of the IEEE 56th CDC, 2017), namely accelerated
					linesearch algorithms requiring only the simple oracle of proximal gradient. While including
					the classical proximal gradient method, our theoretical results cover a broader class of
					algorithms and provide convergence guarantees for accelerated methods with possibly inexact
					computation of the proximal mapping. These findings have also significant practical impact,
					as they widen scope and performance of existing, and possibly future, general purpose optimization
					software that invoke PANOC as inner solver.

					This paper introduces QPDO, a primal-dual method for convex quadratic programs which
					builds upon and weaves together the proximal point algorithm and a damped semismooth
					Newton's method. The outer proximal regularization yields a numerically stable method,
					and we interpret the proximal operator as the unconstrained minimization of the primal-dual
					proximal augmented Lagrangian function. This allows the inner Newton's scheme to exploit
					sparse symmetric linear solvers and multi-rank factorization updates. Moreover, the linear
					systems are always solvable independently from the problem data and exact linesearch can
					be performed. The proposed method can handle degenerate problems, provides a mechanism
					for infeasibility detection, and can exploit warm starting, while requiring only convexity. We
					present details of our open-source C implementation and report on numerical results against
					state-of-the-art solvers. QPDO proves to be a simple, robust, and efficient numerical method
					for convex quadratic programming.

					This paper concerns the optimal control of a continuous-time dynamical system via
					continuous and discrete-valued control variables, where the objective functional also
					accounts for state-independent switching costs. The class of mixed-integer optimal
					control problems is interpreted as a bilevel problem, involving both switching times
					optimization, for a given sequence of modes, and purely continuous optimal control.
					Additionally, an original nonconvex formulation for the switching costs is introduced,
					in terms of cardinality, inspired by sparse optimization and compressed sensing techniques.
					We then adopt proximal algorithms to solve the resulting bilevel optimal
					control problem with composite objective function. An efficient routine for evaluating the
					proximal operator is developed. Two examples are numerically solved via a
					proximal gradient method, discussed and compared with the literature. Although this
					work focuses on switched linear time-varying dynamics and quadratic cost functionals
					with a specific formulation of the switching costs, the proposed approach may also
					apply to more general mixed-integer optimal control problems.

					We consider linear-quadratic optimal control problems with free final time and
					terminal state constraints and propose a solution procedure that is particularly useful
					for online feedback control in a model-predictive control (MPC) framework. The procedure
					avoids the standard time transformation, which transforms the problem into
					an equivalent but non-convex optimal control problem on a fixed time horizon. The
					transformed problem typically suffers from many local minima, which might cause instabilities
					in online optimization tasks like LQR or model-predictive control. To avoid
					this drawback of the time transformation we develop a method from the viewpoint
					of bilevel optimal control, which is beneficial especially in online control tasks. The
					novelty of the approach is the optimal final time tracking procedure, for which we
					exploit a property of the Hamiltonian function. To this end we show that within the
					continuous-time closed-loop controlled system the optimal final time linearly decreases
					in time, as one could intuitively expect. Finally, numerical experiments support the
					effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

					Models involving hybrid systems are versatile in their application but difficult to optimize efficiently due to their combinatorial nature.
					This work presents a method to cope with hybrid optimal control problems which,
					in contrast to decomposition techniques, does not require relaxing the integrality constraints.
					Based on the discretize-then-optimize approach, our scheme addresses mixed-integer nonlinear problems under mild assumptions.
					The proposed numerical algorithm builds upon the augmented Lagrangian framework,
					whose subproblems are handled using successive mixed-integer linearizations with trust regions.
					We validate the performance of the numerical routine with extensive investigations using hybrid optimal control problems from different fields of application.
					Promising preliminary results are presented for
					a motion planning task with hysteresis and
					a Lotka-Volterra fishing problem with total variation.

					Digital Twins (DTs) have emerged as a
powerful tool for simulating, predicting, and optimizing the
behavior of complex real-world systems. In many cases, DTs rely
on real-world data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) systems
and leverage Deep Learning (DL) techniques for predictive future
system states. However, DTs often struggle to adapt to dynamic
scenarios where additional IoT devices and new configurations
are introduced, requiring costly data collection and retraining.
In this paper, we address this challenge by exploring the use of
Generative Deep Learning (GDL) to build robust DTs capable
of handling sparse, noisy, and biased sensor data streams. We
propose a transformer-based GDL model that encodes variable-
length collections of IoT devices while supporting predictive
capabilities under novel device configurations and the addition
of new IoT devices. We evaluate our proposed GDL model in
two IoT scenarios: smart homes and smart hydraulics systems,
where physical models are used to generate the ground truth data.
Experimental results demonstrate our approach's adaptability
without retraining, achieving an R2 = 99.5% when adding
a temperature sensor in the smart home scenario (only 0.3%
degradation), and R2 = 83.8% with 5 valves in the smart
hydraulics scenario, comparing favorably to VARX despite VARX
being retrained on each dataset.

					In the past years, online anonymity has attracted strong criticism for its role in shielding 
					online crimes such as cyberbullying, fake news, money laundering, and pedo-pornography. Yet, 
					it also has historically strong supporters who emphasize the necessity of a safe haven for 
					carrying out legal and ethical activities that should not be associated with our real-life 
					personas. We define authenticated anonymity as the possibility of using anonymous accounts 
					that cannot be associated with the real identity of their owner unless a criminal act is being 
					performed through them. Blockchain technology represents a good means for managing this 
					complexity in a secure and trustworthy manner. Several solutions exist in the literature and 
					on the market for anonymous identity, but they confer too much power to their owners, who can 
					decide what to reveal about themselves in total autonomy (self-sovereign identities). In this 
					paper, we present the Authenticated Anonymity Architecture (AAA), a blockchain-based solution 
					for creating authenticated anonymous identities, where the mappings between official and 
					anonymous identities can only be revealed after the necessary consensus of multiple different 
					actors on the blockchain, evaluating the appropriateness and ethicality of the request. We 
					mathematically modeled the architecture and conducted some analytical evaluations, showing 
					that our proposal is resilient and fault-tolerant, even in the case of a huge number of 
					identities managed.

					Nonlinear optimal control problems for trajectory planning with obstacle avoidance present several challenges. 
					While general-purpose optimizers and dynamic programming methods struggle when adopted separately, their 
					combination enabled by a penalty approach is capable of handling highly nonlinear systems while overcoming the
					curse of dimensionality. Nevertheless, using dynamic programming with a fixed state space discretization limits
					the set of reachable solutions, hindering convergence or requiring enormous memory resources for uniformly 
					spaced grids. In this work we solve this issue by incorporating an adaptive refinement of the state space grid,
					splitting cells where needed to better capture the problem structure while requiring less discretization points
					overall. Numerical results on a space manipulator demonstrate the improved robustness and efficiency of the
					combined method with respect to the single components.

					Regularization and interior point approaches offer valuable perspectives to
					address constrained nonlinear optimization problems in view of control applications.
					This paper discusses the interactions between these techniques and proposes an algorithm
					that synergistically combines them.
					Building a sequence of closely related subproblems and approximately solving each of them,
					this approach inherently exploits warm-starting, early termination, and the possibility to
					adopt subsolvers tailored to specific problem structures.
					Moreover, by relaxing the equality constraints with a proximal penalty, the regularized
					subproblems are feasible and satisfy a strong constraint qualification by construction,
					allowing the safe use of efficient solvers.
					We show how regularization benefits the underlying linear algebra and a detailed convergence
					analysis indicates that limit points tend to minimize constraint violation and satisfy
					suitable optimality conditions.
					Finally, we report on numerical results in terms of robustness, indicating that the combined
					approach compares favorably against both interior point and augmented Lagrangian codes.

					Dynamical systems approaches to constrained optimization often rely on a penalization
					term to reach feasible points, at the cost of slower convergence. However, we show one
					can construct a discrete-time system that maintains the same convergence guarantees
					without requiring such penalization term. We demonstrate that the sequential homotopy
					method, namely taking projected backward Euler steps on a projected gradient/anti-gradient
					augmented Lagrangian flow, matches with the classical augmented Lagrangian method without the
					multiplier estimate update. Then, we introduce a time-scaled flow and provide an
					interpretation of augmented Lagrangian methods as discrete-time dynamical systems. This
					approach inspires a simple yet effective method for nonlinear programming. We report on
					numerical results for equality-constrained problems.

					In this paper we reformulate a switching times optimization problem with non-uniform
					switching costs and dwell-time constraints via direct multiple shooting, sparsity-inducing
					regularization and semi-continuous variables. The transformed problem has composite
					smooth/nonsmooth objective function and smooth constraints. Necessary optimality conditions for
					such problems are derived, resembling results from smooth optimization. A
					safeguarded, primal-dual, augmented Lagrangian proximal method is proposed for its
					numerical solution, and the global convergence toward points satisfying the necessary conditions is
					detailed. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the efficacy and limitations of the method.

					The switching times optimization problem for switched dynamical systems, with fixed
					initial state, is considered. A nonnegative cost term for changing dynamics is introduced to
					induce a sparse switching structure, that is, to reduce the number of switches. To deal with
					such problems, an inexact Newton-type arc search proximal method, based on a parametric
					local quadratic model of the cost function, is proposed. Numerical investigations and
					comparisons on a small-scale benchmark problem are presented and discussed.

					We investigate real asymmetric linear systems arising in the search direction generation in a
					nonsmooth Newton's method. This applies to constrained optimisation
					problems via reformulation of the necessary conditions into an equivalent nonlinear
					and nonsmooth system of equations. We propose a strategy to exploit the problem
					structure. First, based on the sub-blocks of the original matrix, some variables are
					selected and ruled out for a posteriori recovering; then, a smaller and symmetric linear
					system is generated; eventually, from the solution of the latter, the remaining variables are
					obtained. We prove the method is applicable if the original linear system
					is well-posed. We propose and discuss different selection strategies. Finally, numerical examples
					are presented to compare this method with the direct approach without
					exploitation, for full and sparse matrices, in a wide range of problem size.

					This paper discusses a bilevel optimization approach for free finite final time optimal
					control problems and addresses a numerical method for their approximate solution. The core
					idea is to decouple the final time optimization from the optimal control
					and state trajectory. This is rigorously formulated as an equivalent bilevel problem
					seeking, at the upper level, the optimal final time and optimal control and corresponding
					state at the lower level. Standard solvers for nonlinear optimal control can deal
					with the latter, while the former is a box-constrained optimization problem with one
					scalar decision variable. The interface between the two levels is based on the Hamilton
					function associated to the problem and its relationship with the cost function.
					A method for solving the upper level problem is developed, that combines a tailored
					fast first-order method with a robust and guaranteed root-finding algorithm. Finally,
					numerical results demonstrate the robustness of the method and show its limitations.

					The paper introduces an iterative solution algorithm for a bi-level optimization
					problem arising in traffic control. The bi-level problem consists of a shortest path
					problem on the upper level, which aims at minimizing the total path cost of a set of
					cars in a road network. The cost coefficients in the shortest path problem represent
					the expected driving time on each edge, accounting for congestions, and depend on
					the solutions of a set of lower level optimal control problems, each one describing
					the behavior of a single minimum-time driven car. On the other hand, each lower
					level problem is built upon the path planned by the upper level. This leads to a
					strong coupling between upper level problem and lower level problem. This coupling
					is decomposed by an iterative procedure fixing either the costs or the paths in the
					upper level and the lower level, respectively. Numerical experiments illustrate the
					procedure and indicate that the iterative algorithm leads to suitable distribution of
					cars in the network.

					This paper addresses the problem of modelling and simulation of the vehicular
					traffic flow in a road network by adopting a measure-theoretic framework. This allows
					to describe the system from both, a microscopic and a macroscopic point-of-view
					simultaneously, in the sense that two scales co-exist and are coupled, namely a set of
					moving agents and an average density. The resulting mathematical model consists of a
					strongly coupled PDE-ODE system with non-local interactions. Within this work we
					specify this multiscale model for a single-lane roundabout, that is, an example of a road
					network. Then, we focus on the computational aspects in order to develop a setup for
					numerical simulations and to analyse the results of some experiments. This multiscale
					simulator can reproduce phenomena that characterize the real physical system, e.g.
					self-organization effects, and thus it can be adopted as an environment for control
					algorithms benchmarking or as a tool for simulation-based traffic flow control and
					optimization.

					This paper describes the use of optimal control theory applied to the motion of
					a low-power laser beam to precisely move a droplet in a liquid layer by means of
					the force on the liquid-liquid interface arising due to the surrounding thermal field
					(thermocapillary force and Marangoni effect). The form of heat field equations is
					approximated by the solution of a finite sum of laser pulses, whose analytical solution
					can be explicitly derived. In this way, the model of the system does not contain any
					partial differential equation (PDE). Optimization is performed by using the direct
					approach method and the <code>fmincon</code> solver provided by MATLAB. The initial guess
					is found with a simple model predictive controller. Perspective applications of this
					technology include beam-controlled targeting of pharmaceuticals in organic tissues.

					This thesis aims at investigating and developing numerical methods for finite dimensional
					constrained
					structured optimization problems. These provide a modeling framework for a variety of applications,
					as they offer a simple yet expressive language to formulate a broad class of problems. An algorithm
					is proposed that interlaces proximal methods and the augmented Lagrangian scheme. Relying on
					theoretical results, convergence guarantees are established for nonconvex problems. The inner
					subproblems
					can be solved by any method for structured optimization and the overall algorithm can
					be made matrix-free. Illustrative examples show the benefits of constrained structured programs
					as a modeling tool and of a careful problem formulation. When tested and compared on small to
					medium-size nonlinear programming benchmark problems, the proposed method prove competitive
					against a state-of-the-art solver.
					The proposed framework is adopted in the context of switching time optimization for constrained
					mixed-integer optimal control with switching costs. We describe the reformulation as constrained
					structured programs via the cardinality function, and discuss possible extensions to deal with more
					general problems. Then, we prove that this formulation satisfies the assumptions underlying the
					proximal augmented Lagrangian algorithm. Numerical examples show the filtering action of switching
					costs, which rules out chattering solutions.
					Finally, we develop a primal-dual Newton-type proximal method for convex quadratic programming. This
					is
					based on the proposed proximal augmented Lagrangian framework and weaves together
					the proximal point algorithm and a damped semismooth Newton's method. The outer proximal
					regularization yields a numerically stable method, and we interpret the proximal operator as the
					unconstrained minimization of the primal-dual proximal augmented Lagrangian function. The inner
					tailored Newton's scheme is fast, the linear systems are always solvable, and exact linesearch can
					be
					performed. The method handles degenerate problems, provides a mechanism for infeasibility detection,
					and exploits warm starting, while requiring only convexity. Numerical results against full-fledged
					solvers demonstrate our method is robust and efficient.
					All proposed algorithms are implemented in software packages that allow for the generic, efficient
					solution of problems using the methods developed in this thesis.

					The aim of the present thesis is to analyse the migration of a droplet suspended in
					another liquid in a flat open container and to explore and exploit different strategies
					to control the motion of the droplet. In particular, the actuation mechanism is the
					thermocapillary effect, induced by temperature gradients generated by a focused laser beam.
					A mathematical model representing the system dynamics is presented, which has been
					employed with different purposes, from the dynamic simulation up to the synthesis of a
					controller. Two models are proposed to take into account the thermal dynamics of the
					suspending liquid, based on a semi-analytical solution and finite
					elements method, respectively. The model presents characteristic parameters that
					should be evaluated, therefore the identification problem is discussed and accompanied
					by experimental results. Also the state estimation is a key step when the controller
					has to be implemented in practice. About this, estimation algorithms are suggested
					and analysed. The optimal control theory is utilised to address the considered control
					problems, which are the minimum time and the reference tracking problems. Both
					trajectory optimization and model-predictive control are investigated and promising
					results have been highlighted. This work aims then at marking the beginning of optimal
					control in droplet manipulation, as well as at representing a potential guideline for
					coping with similar projects.
