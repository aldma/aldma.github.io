			Dynamical systems approaches to constrained optimization often rely on a penalization term to reach
			feasible points. We demonstrate that the sequential homotopy method, namely taking projected backward
			Euler steps on a projected gradient/antigradient augmented Lagrangian flow, coincides with the classical
			augmented Lagrangian method without the multiplier estimate update. Then, we introduce a time-scaled flow
			and provide an interpretation of augmented Lagrangian methods as discrete-time dynamical systems. This
			approach inspires a simple yet effective method for nonlinear programming. We report on numerical results
			for equality-constrained problems.

			This paper introduces QPDO, a primal-dual method for convex quadratic programs which
			builds upon and weaves together the proximal point algorithm and a damped semismooth
			Newton’s method. The outer proximal regularization yields a numerically stable method,
			and we interpret the proximal operator as the unconstrained minimization of the primal-dual
			proximal augmented Lagrangian function. This allows the inner Newton’s scheme to exploit
			sparse symmetric linear solvers and multi-rank factorization updates. Moreover, the linear
			systems are always solvable independently from the problem data and exact linesearch can
			be performed. The proposed method can handle degenerate problems, provides a mechanism
			for infeasibility detection, and can exploit warm starting, while requiring only convexity. We
			present details of our open-source C implementation and report on numerical results against
			state-of-the-art solvers. QPDO proves to be a simple, robust, and efficient numerical method
			for convex quadratic programming.

			This paper concerns the optimal control of a continuous-time dynamical system via
			continuous and discrete-valued control variables, where the objective functional also
			accounts for state-independent switching costs. The class of mixed-integer optimal
			control problems is interpreted as a bilevel problem, involving both switching times
			optimization, for a given sequence of modes, and purely continuous optimal control.
			Additionally, an original nonconvex formulation for the switching costs is introduced,
			in terms of cardinality, inspired by sparse optimization and compressed sensing techniques.
			We then adopt proximal algorithms to solve the resulting bilevel optimal
			control problem with composite objective function. An efficient routine for evaluating the
			proximal operator is developed. Two examples are numerically solved via a
			proximal gradient method, discussed and compared with the literature. Although this
			work focuses on switched linear time-varying dynamics and quadratic cost functionals
			with a specific formulation of the switching costs, the proposed approach may also
			apply to more general mixed-integer optimal control problems.

			We consider linear-quadratic optimal control problems with free final time and
			terminal state constraints and propose a solution procedure that is particularly useful
			for online feedback control in a model-predictive control (MPC) framework. The procedure avoids the standard time transformation, which transforms the problem into
			an equivalent but non-convex optimal control problem on a fixed time horizon. The
			transformed problem typically suffers from many local minima, which might cause instabilities in online optimization tasks like LQR or model-predictive control. To avoid
			this drawback of the time transformation we develop a method from the viewpoint
			of bilevel optimal control, which is beneficial especially in online control tasks. The
			novelty of the approach is the optimal final time tracking procedure, for which we
			exploit a property of the Hamiltonian function. To this end we show that within the
			continuous-time closed-loop controlled system the optimal final time linearly decreases
			in time, as one could intuitively expect. Finally, numerical experiments support the
			effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

			In this paper we reformulate a switching times optimization problem with non-uniform
			switching costs and dwell-time constraints via direct multiple shooting, sparsity-inducing
			regularization and semi-continuous variables. The transformed problem has composite
			smooth/nonsmooth objective function and smooth constraints. Necessary optimality conditions for
			such problems are derived, resembling results from smooth optimization. A
			safeguarded, primal-dual, augmented Lagrangian proximal method is proposed for its
			numerical solution, and the global convergence toward points satisfying the necessary conditions is
			detailed. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the efficacy and limitations of the method.

			The switching times optimization problem for switched dynamical systems, with fixed
			initial state, is considered. A nonnegative cost term for changing dynamics is introduced to
			induce a sparse switching structure, that is, to reduce the number of switches. To deal with
			such problems, an inexact Newton-type arc search proximal method, based on a parametric
			local quadratic model of the cost function, is proposed. Numerical investigations and
			comparisons on a small-scale benchmark problem are presented and discussed.

			We investigate real asymmetric linear systems arising in the search direction generation in a
			nonsmooth Newton’s method. This applies to constrained optimisation
			problems via reformulation of the necessary conditions into an equivalent nonlinear
			and nonsmooth system of equations. We propose a strategy to exploit the problem
			structure. First, based on the sub-blocks of the original matrix, some variables are
			selected and ruled out for a posteriori recovering; then, a smaller and symmetric linear
			system is generated; eventually, from the solution of the latter, the remaining variables are
			obtained. We prove the method is applicable if the original linear system
			is well-posed. We propose and discuss different selection strategies. Finally, numerical examples
			are presented to compare this method with the direct approach without
			exploitation, for full and sparse matrices, in a wide range of problem size.

			This paper discusses a bilevel optimization approach for free finite final time optimal
			control problems and addresses a numerical method for their approximate solution. The core
			idea is to decouple the final time optimization from the optimal control
			and state trajectory. This is rigorously formulated as an equivalent bilevel problem
			seeking, at the upper level, the optimal final time and optimal control and corresponding
			state at the lower level. Standard solvers for nonlinear optimal control can deal
			with the latter, while the former is a box-constrained optimization problem with one
			scalar decision variable. The interface between the two levels is based on the Hamilton
			function associated to the problem and its relationship with the cost function.
			A method for solving the upper level problem is developed, that combines a tailored
			fast first-order method with a robust and guaranteed root-finding algorithm. Finally,
			numerical results demonstrate the robustness of the method and show its limitations.

			This paper addresses the problem of modelling and simulation of the vehicular
			traffic flow in a road network by adopting a measure-theoretic framework. This allows
			to describe the system from both, a microscopic and a macroscopic point-of-view
			simultaneously, in the sense that two scales co-exist and are coupled, namely a set of
			moving agents and an average density. The resulting mathematical model consists of a
			strongly coupled PDE-ODE system with non-local interactions. Within this work we
			specify this multiscale model for a single-lane roundabout, that is, an example of a road
			network. Then, we focus on the computational aspects in order to develop a setup for
			numerical simulations and to analyse the results of some experiments. This multiscale
			simulator can reproduce phenomena that characterize the real physical system, e.g.
			self-organization effects, and thus it can be adopted as an environment for control
			algorithms benchmarking or as a tool for simulation-based traffic flow control and
			optimization.

			This paper describes the use of optimal control theory applied to the motion of
			a low-power laser beam to precisely move a droplet in a liquid layer by means of
			the force on the liquid-liquid interface arising due to the surrounding thermal field
			(thermocapillary force and Marangoni effect). The form of heat field equations is
			approximated by the solution of a finite sum of laser pulses, whose analytical solution
			can be explicitly derived. In this way, the model of the system does not contain any
			partial differential equation (PDE). Optimization is performed by using the direct
			approach method and the <code>fmincon</code> solver provided by MATLAB. The initial guess
			is found with a simple model predictive controller. Perspective applications of this
			technology include beam-controlled targeting of pharmaceuticals in organic tissues.

			The paper introduces an iterative solution algorithm for a bi-level optimization
			problem arising in traffic control. The bi-level problem consists of a shortest path
			problem on the upper level, which aims at minimizing the total path cost of a set of
			cars in a road network. The cost coefficients in the shortest path problem represent
			the expected driving time on each edge, accounting for congestions, and depend on
			the solutions of a set of lower level optimal control problems, each one describing
			the behavior of a single minimum-time driven car. On the other hand, each lower
			level problem is built upon the path planned by the upper level. This leads to a
			strong coupling between upper level problem and lower level problem. This coupling
			is decomposed by an iterative procedure fixing either the costs or the paths in the
			upper level and the lower level, respectively. Numerical experiments illustrate the
			procedure and indicate that the iterative algorithm leads to suitable distribution of
			cars in the network.
