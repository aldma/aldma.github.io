			Regularization and interior point approaches offer valuable perspectives to 
			address constrained nonlinear optimization problems in view of control applications.
			This paper discusses the interactions between these techniques and proposes an algorithm 
			that synergistically combines them.
			Building a sequence of closely related subproblems and approximately solving each of them, 
			this approach inherently exploits warm-starting, early termination, and the possibility to 
			adopt subsolvers tailored to specific problem structures.
			Moreover, by relaxing the equality constraints with a proximal penalty, the regularized 
			subproblems are feasible and satisfy a strong constraint qualification by construction, 
			allowing the safe use of efficient solvers.
			We show how regularization benefits the underlying linear algebra and a detailed convergence 
			analysis indicates that limit points tend to minimize constraint violation and satisfy 
			suitable optimality conditions.
			Finally, we report on numerical results in terms of robustness, indicating that the combined 
			approach compares favorably against both interior point and augmented Lagrangian codes.

			Complex IoT ecosystems often require the usage of
			Digital Twins (DTs) of their physical assets in order to perform
			predictive analytics and simulate what-if scenarios. DTs are able
			to replicate IoT devices and adapt over time to their behavioral
			changes. However, DTs in IoT are typically tailored to a specific
			use case, without the possibility to seamlessly adapt to different
			scenarios. Further, the fragmentation of IoT poses additional
			challenges on how to deploy DTs in heterogeneous scenarios
			characterized by the usage of multiple data formats and IoT
			network protocols. In this paper, we propose the Relativistic
			Digital Twin (RDT) framework, through which we automatically
			generate general purpose DTs of IoT entities and tune their
			behavioral models over time by constantly observing their real
			counterparts. The framework relies on the object representation
			via the Web of Things (WoT), to offer a standardized interface to
			each of the IoT devices as well as to their DTs. To this purpose,
			we extended the W3C WoT standard in order to encompass
			the concept of behavioral model and define it in the Thing
			Description (TD) through a new vocabulary. Finally, we evaluated
			the RDT framework over two disjoint use cases to assess its
			correctness and learning performance, i.e., the DT of a simulated
			smart home scenario with the capability of forecasting the indoor
			temperature, and the DT of a real-world drone with the capability
			of forecasting its trajectory in an outdoor scenario.

			We consider composite minimization problems subject to smooth inequality constraints and present a 
			flexible algorithm that combines interior point (IP) and proximal gradient schemes. While traditional 
			IP methods cannot cope with nonsmooth objective functions and proximal algorithms cannot handle 
			complicated constraints, their combined usage is shown to successfully compensate the respective 
			shortcomings. We provide a theoretical characterization of the algorithm and its asymptotic properties, 
			deriving convergence results for fully nonconvex problems, thus bridging the gap with previous works 
			that successfully addressed the convex case. Our interior proximal gradient algorithm benefits from 
			warm starting, generates strictly feasible iterates with decreasing objective value, and returns after 
			finitely many iterations a primal-dual pair approximately satisfying suitable optimality conditions.

			We present a novel approach for approximating the primal and dual parameter dependent
			solution functions of parametric optimization problems. We start with an equation
			reformulation of the first order necessary optimality conditions. Then, we replace
			the primal and dual solutions with some approximating functions and find for some
			test parameters optimal coefficients as solution of a single nonlinear least-squares
			problem. Under mild assumptions it can be shown that stationary points are global
			minima and that the function approximations interpolate the solution functions at
			all test parameters. Further, we have a cheap function evaluation criterion to estimate
			the approximation error. Finally, we present some preliminary numerical results showing
			the viability of our approach.

			Composite optimization offers a powerful modeling tool for a variety of applications and is
			often numerically solved by means of proximal gradient methods. In this paper, we consider
			fully nonconvex composite problems under only local Lipschitz gradient continuity for the
			smooth part of the objective function. We investigate an adaptive scheme for PANOC-type methods
			(Stella et al. in Proceedings of the IEEE 56th CDC, 2017), namely accelerated
			linesearch algorithms requiring only the simple oracle of proximal gradient. While including
			the classical proximal gradient method, our theoretical results cover a broader class of
			algorithms and provide convergence guarantees for accelerated methods with possibly inexact
			computation of the proximal mapping. These findings have also significant practical impact,
			as they widen scope and performance of existing, and possibly future, general purpose optimization
			software that invoke PANOC as inner solver.

			This paper introduces QPDO, a primal-dual method for convex quadratic programs which
			builds upon and weaves together the proximal point algorithm and a damped semismooth
			Newton’s method. The outer proximal regularization yields a numerically stable method,
			and we interpret the proximal operator as the unconstrained minimization of the primal-dual
			proximal augmented Lagrangian function. This allows the inner Newton’s scheme to exploit
			sparse symmetric linear solvers and multi-rank factorization updates. Moreover, the linear
			systems are always solvable independently from the problem data and exact linesearch can
			be performed. The proposed method can handle degenerate problems, provides a mechanism
			for infeasibility detection, and can exploit warm starting, while requiring only convexity. We
			present details of our open-source C implementation and report on numerical results against
			state-of-the-art solvers. QPDO proves to be a simple, robust, and efficient numerical method
			for convex quadratic programming.

			This paper concerns the optimal control of a continuous-time dynamical system via
			continuous and discrete-valued control variables, where the objective functional also
			accounts for state-independent switching costs. The class of mixed-integer optimal
			control problems is interpreted as a bilevel problem, involving both switching times
			optimization, for a given sequence of modes, and purely continuous optimal control.
			Additionally, an original nonconvex formulation for the switching costs is introduced,
			in terms of cardinality, inspired by sparse optimization and compressed sensing techniques.
			We then adopt proximal algorithms to solve the resulting bilevel optimal
			control problem with composite objective function. An efficient routine for evaluating the
			proximal operator is developed. Two examples are numerically solved via a
			proximal gradient method, discussed and compared with the literature. Although this
			work focuses on switched linear time-varying dynamics and quadratic cost functionals
			with a specific formulation of the switching costs, the proposed approach may also
			apply to more general mixed-integer optimal control problems.

			We consider linear-quadratic optimal control problems with free final time and
			terminal state constraints and propose a solution procedure that is particularly useful
			for online feedback control in a model-predictive control (MPC) framework. The procedure avoids the standard time transformation, which transforms the problem into
			an equivalent but non-convex optimal control problem on a fixed time horizon. The
			transformed problem typically suffers from many local minima, which might cause instabilities in online optimization tasks like LQR or model-predictive control. To avoid
			this drawback of the time transformation we develop a method from the viewpoint
			of bilevel optimal control, which is beneficial especially in online control tasks. The
			novelty of the approach is the optimal final time tracking procedure, for which we
			exploit a property of the Hamiltonian function. To this end we show that within the
			continuous-time closed-loop controlled system the optimal final time linearly decreases
			in time, as one could intuitively expect. Finally, numerical experiments support the
			effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

			Dynamical systems approaches to constrained optimization often rely on a penalization
			term to reach feasible points, at the cost of slower convergence. However, we show one
			can construct a discrete-time system that maintains the same convergence guarantees
			without requiring such penalization term. We demonstrate that the sequential homotopy
			method, namely taking projected backward Euler steps on a projected gradient/anti-gradient
			augmented Lagrangian flow, matches with the classical augmented Lagrangian method without the
			multiplier estimate update. Then, we introduce a time-scaled flow and provide an
			interpretation of augmented Lagrangian methods as discrete-time dynamical systems. This
			approach inspires a simple yet effective method for nonlinear programming. We report on
			numerical results for equality-constrained problems.

			In this paper we reformulate a switching times optimization problem with non-uniform
			switching costs and dwell-time constraints via direct multiple shooting, sparsity-inducing
			regularization and semi-continuous variables. The transformed problem has composite
			smooth/nonsmooth objective function and smooth constraints. Necessary optimality conditions for
			such problems are derived, resembling results from smooth optimization. A
			safeguarded, primal-dual, augmented Lagrangian proximal method is proposed for its
			numerical solution, and the global convergence toward points satisfying the necessary conditions is
			detailed. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the efficacy and limitations of the method.

			The switching times optimization problem for switched dynamical systems, with fixed

			such problems, an inexact Newton-type arc search proximal method, based on a parametric
			local quadratic model of the cost function, is proposed. Numerical investigations and
			comparisons on a small-scale benchmark problem are presented and discussed.

			We investigate real asymmetric linear systems arising in the search direction generation in a
			nonsmooth Newton’s method. This applies to constrained optimisation
			problems via reformulation of the necessary conditions into an equivalent nonlinear
			and nonsmooth system of equations. We propose a strategy to exploit the problem
			structure. First, based on the sub-blocks of the original matrix, some variables are
			selected and ruled out for a posteriori recovering; then, a smaller and symmetric linear
			system is generated; eventually, from the solution of the latter, the remaining variables are
			obtained. We prove the method is applicable if the original linear system
			is well-posed. We propose and discuss different selection strategies. Finally, numerical examples
			are presented to compare this method with the direct approach without
			exploitation, for full and sparse matrices, in a wide range of problem size.

			This paper discusses a bilevel optimization approach for free finite final time optimal
			control problems and addresses a numerical method for their approximate solution. The core
			idea is to decouple the final time optimization from the optimal control
			and state trajectory. This is rigorously formulated as an equivalent bilevel problem
			seeking, at the upper level, the optimal final time and optimal control and corresponding
			state at the lower level. Standard solvers for nonlinear optimal control can deal
			with the latter, while the former is a box-constrained optimization problem with one
			scalar decision variable. The interface between the two levels is based on the Hamilton
			function associated to the problem and its relationship with the cost function.
			A method for solving the upper level problem is developed, that combines a tailored
			fast first-order method with a robust and guaranteed root-finding algorithm. Finally,
			numerical results demonstrate the robustness of the method and show its limitations.

			This paper addresses the problem of modelling and simulation of the vehicular
			traffic flow in a road network by adopting a measure-theoretic framework. This allows
			to describe the system from both, a microscopic and a macroscopic point-of-view
			simultaneously, in the sense that two scales co-exist and are coupled, namely a set of
			moving agents and an average density. The resulting mathematical model consists of a
			strongly coupled PDE-ODE system with non-local interactions. Within this work we
			specify this multiscale model for a single-lane roundabout, that is, an example of a road
			network. Then, we focus on the computational aspects in order to develop a setup for
			numerical simulations and to analyse the results of some experiments. This multiscale
			simulator can reproduce phenomena that characterize the real physical system, e.g.
			self-organization effects, and thus it can be adopted as an environment for control
			algorithms benchmarking or as a tool for simulation-based traffic flow control and
			optimization.

			This paper describes the use of optimal control theory applied to the motion of
			a low-power laser beam to precisely move a droplet in a liquid layer by means of
			the force on the liquid-liquid interface arising due to the surrounding thermal field
			(thermocapillary force and Marangoni effect). The form of heat field equations is
			approximated by the solution of a finite sum of laser pulses, whose analytical solution
			can be explicitly derived. In this way, the model of the system does not contain any
			partial differential equation (PDE). Optimization is performed by using the direct
			approach method and the <code>fmincon</code> solver provided by MATLAB. The initial guess
			is found with a simple model predictive controller. Perspective applications of this
			technology include beam-controlled targeting of pharmaceuticals in organic tissues.

			The paper introduces an iterative solution algorithm for a bi-level optimization
			problem arising in traffic control. The bi-level problem consists of a shortest path
			problem on the upper level, which aims at minimizing the total path cost of a set of
			cars in a road network. The cost coefficients in the shortest path problem represent
			the expected driving time on each edge, accounting for congestions, and depend on
			the solutions of a set of lower level optimal control problems, each one describing
			the behavior of a single minimum-time driven car. On the other hand, each lower
			level problem is built upon the path planned by the upper level. This leads to a
			strong coupling between upper level problem and lower level problem. This coupling
			is decomposed by an iterative procedure fixing either the costs or the paths in the
			upper level and the lower level, respectively. Numerical experiments illustrate the
			procedure and indicate that the iterative algorithm leads to suitable distribution of
			cars in the network.

			This thesis aims at investigating and developing numerical methods for finite dimensional constrained
			structured optimization problems. These provide a modeling framework for a variety of applications,
			as they offer a simple yet expressive language to formulate a broad class of problems. An algorithm
			is proposed that interlaces proximal methods and the augmented Lagrangian scheme. Relying on
			theoretical results, convergence guarantees are established for nonconvex problems. The inner subproblems
			can be solved by any method for structured optimization and the overall algorithm can
			be made matrix-free. Illustrative examples show the benefits of constrained structured programs
			as a modeling tool and of a careful problem formulation. When tested and compared on small to
			medium-size nonlinear programming benchmark problems, the proposed method prove competitive
			against a state-of-the-art solver.
			The proposed framework is adopted in the context of switching time optimization for constrained
			mixed-integer optimal control with switching costs. We describe the reformulation as constrained
			structured programs via the cardinality function, and discuss possible extensions to deal with more
			general problems. Then, we prove that this formulation satisfies the assumptions underlying the
			proximal augmented Lagrangian algorithm. Numerical examples show the filtering action of switching
			costs, which rules out chattering solutions.
			Finally, we develop a primal-dual Newton-type proximal method for convex quadratic programming. This is
			based on the proposed proximal augmented Lagrangian framework and weaves together
			the proximal point algorithm and a damped semismooth Newton's method. The outer proximal
			regularization yields a numerically stable method, and we interpret the proximal operator as the
			unconstrained minimization of the primal-dual proximal augmented Lagrangian function. The inner
			tailored Newton's scheme is fast, the linear systems are always solvable, and exact linesearch can be
			performed. The method handles degenerate problems, provides a mechanism for infeasibility detection,
			and exploits warm starting, while requiring only convexity. Numerical results against full-fledged
			solvers demonstrate our method is robust and efficient.
			All proposed algorithms are implemented in software packages that allow for the generic, efficient
			solution of problems using the methods developed in this thesis.

			The aim of the present thesis is to analyse the migration of a droplet suspended in
			another liquid in a flat open container and to explore and exploit different strategies
			to control the motion of the droplet. In particular, the actuation mechanism is the
			thermocapillary effect, induced by temperature gradients generated by a focused laser beam.
			A mathematical model representing the system dynamics is presented, which has been
			employed with different purposes, from the dynamic simulation up to the synthesis of a
			controller. Two models are proposed to take into account the thermal dynamics of the
			suspending liquid, based on a semi-analytical solution and finite
			elements method, respectively. The model presents characteristic parameters that
			should be evaluated, therefore the identification problem is discussed and accompanied
			by experimental results. Also the state estimation is a key step when the controller
			has to be implemented in practice. About this, estimation algorithms are suggested
			and analysed. The optimal control theory is utilised to address the considered control
			problems, which are the minimum time and the reference tracking problems. Both
			trajectory optimization and model-predictive control are investigated and promising
			results have been highlighted. This work aims then at marking the beginning of optimal
			control in droplet manipulation, as well as at representing a potential guideline for
			coping with similar projects.
