		<h2>About me</h2>

		<p>
			I am a Research Associate at the Institute for Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computing at <a
				href="https://www.unibw.de/lrt1">UniBw M</a>, Germany.
			My scientific activity revolves around computational optimization, with applications ranging from control
			systems to data science.
		</p>
		<p>
			In Fall 2022, I was a Visiting Research Associate with <a
				href="https://research.curtin.edu.au/optimisation/">Ryan Loxton</a> at Curtin University, Australia.
			Previously, I obtained my doctoral degree from UniBw M (2021), advised by <a
				href="https://www.unibw.de/ingmathe">Matthias Gerdts</a>.
			I received a MSc in Mechatronics Engineering (2016) and a BSc in Industrial Engineering (2014) from <a
				href="https://www.dii.unitn.it/">UniTn</a>.
			I grew up in Italy, between Venice and the Dolomites.
		</p>
		<p>
			&#x1F331; I enjoy reading about the problem of mind and I am curious about how people came to be curious.
			Asimov's <em>Foundation</em>,
			Tolstoy's <em>War and Peace</em>, and AndriÄ‡'s <em>The Bridge on the Drina</em> are among my favourite
			books.
		</p>

		<h2>Research</h2>

		<p>
			Think twice, code once, compute once.
		</p>
		<p>
			A sustainable future demands efficient and scalable methods for decision-making and problem-solving.
			Computational optimization can help us thrive along with our Planet.
		</p>
		<p>
			&#x1F52D;
			I focus on analysing mathematical models and developing numerical tools that are general, robust, and yet
			simple.
			By exploiting structures, we can design and deploy widely applicable, reliable, and fast algorithms for our
			daily life.
			For me, this means walking on the edge of bizarre problem classes to better grasp their essence.
			<!--I am fascinated by the interplay between numerical optimization, linear algebra, and the underlying computing system.-->
		</p>
		<p>
			I have the pleasure of sharing this journey with great collaborators, colleagues, and friends, all over the
			world.
			Theoretical aspects, numerical properties, algorithmic design, and practical implementations are all part of
			our investigations.
			Recently, we have been working on
		<p>
			&#8618; stabilized, primal-dual Newton-type methods for nonlinear programming; <br>
			&#8618; proximal gradient algorithms for structured optimization; <br>
			&#8618; Lagrangian and proximal methods for generalized programming; <br>
			&#8618; bridging the gap between discrete and continuous optimization.
